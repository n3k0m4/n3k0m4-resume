      <description>Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments. Eliminates uses of intensive backend query, replacing it with an asynchronous API call against a lucene index. This change reduces page load from from 2+ minutes to nearly instant, with an incredibly responsive UI.</description>

      <description>NLP (natural language processing) is the field of artificial intelligence that deals with the processing, analysis and understanding of natural language. It began to emerge and play an indispensable role since the 1950s with its usefulness in document translation, text indexing, and text-like data mining.
The advancement in the use of NLP tools has followed an exceptional development, from an automatic translator at the beginning to an assistant that structures information into computer-understandable data to eventually a more developed and complex form that began since the 2000s with the help of growth in artiﬁcial intelligence hardware, big data, and deep learning.</description>

      <title>Added Docker Build Status Badge to shields.io</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/contributions/shields-docker/</link>

      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&amp;rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <title>Forcing Visits to use SSL</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/force-ssl/</link>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description>

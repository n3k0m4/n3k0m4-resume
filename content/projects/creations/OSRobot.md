description: "This project was our shot at the opertaing systems' project for Eurecom called Eurecom Kart. Our beloved r00b0t was close to get first place (in a perfect world).</br></br> 
The Eurecom Kart project consists of building a robot using the EV3 Brick, to play a game where it has to win a race against other teamsâ€™ robots while throwing and escaping obstacles. The programming side of this project was done thanks to low level techniques acquired during the OS lectures."

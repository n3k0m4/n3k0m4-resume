description: "This project is a crypto trading bot. As soon as I got into cryptocurrencies, I started learning about trading strategies and wondered why I've never seen some strategies I thought of. So I decided, with two of my friends, to code a bot that implements those strategies and backtest it on Binance's data for the ETH/USDT market.
<br/>
The bot performed slightly better than a <em>HODL</em> strategy, and has a lot of room for improvement.
<br/><br/>
Parts of the Binance backtesting integration will soon be published publicly as a library.

description: "ScrapperIO is a solution that lets users program recurrent scrapping jobs and get alerted depending on the result of
the scrapped content without writing code. It comes with a helper extension that helps the user select the part they want scrape and a UI that lets you manage your scraping jobs. <br/> <br/>

The project is still a work in progress and is not public at the moment.<br/>
